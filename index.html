  <h2>IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It is a professional association for electrical and electronic engineering.</h2><br>
  <h3>IEEE GIT:</h3><br>
  <p>The IEEE at Gogte Institute of Technology is a leading IEEE of North Karnataka. Inspire students about the new technological invention its playing a major role in grabbing the attention of many students toward advancement in technology.With its motto being imporving the techino-managerialof the students, IEEE has organised numerous webinars and talks by inspiring personalitities to guideand motivate the budding Engineers of the region.It has played a major role in promotting the innovations in technology in the region by organising many exciting competitions for many students from different colleges of region.</p><br>
  <h3>IEEE INDIA:</h3><br>
  <P>IEEE India council is the umbrella organization which coordinates all IEEE activities in India.

<h3>IEEE World's largest technical organization</h3><br>
<h3>History of IEEE:</h3><br>
<p>The roots of formation of IEEE comes from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the
Institute of Radio Engineers in the year 1963.Its corporate office is at New York and its operations center is
in Piscataway, New Jersey.<br>
In 1884, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was formed. And in 1912, the rival Institution of
Radio Engineers was formed. Although AIEE was initially large, later IRE attracted large number of students.</p><br>
<h3>Growth of IEEE:</h3><br>
<p>The two institutions, AIEE and IRE merged to form IEEE on 1st January 1963. At that time, the group had
150,000 members. By 1984, there were 250,000 members. Today IEEE has over 500,000 members in about 160
countries across the world.<br>
With its tagline being “ ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY FOR HUMANITY”.

In the 1985, the student branch at GIT emerged with just 4-5 active members of the IEEE. Later it grew large to become the Active Student Branch in North Karnataka , and as help numerous Student Branch to grow big.<br>
Earlier the Student Branch was just publishing only the technical papers, later as it grew it started paving way to many student activities and student technical <br>
The Student Branch aims at becoming the best Student Branch and the best BC. It gives assurance of giving the students the best of facilities for the enhancement of the required techino-managerial skills. The outstanding events held will give the quality certification for the skills an individual posess.<br>
The student branch focuses on conducting social and technical activities for students and encourage them to take advantage of the IEEE membership which includes the participation in events,conferences,competition and many more.<br>
PAANCHAJANYA:<br>
Paanchajanya is a annual flagship organized by the Student Branch at GIT. With its motto being “EDUTAINMENT” which means education with entertainment which will be the students enhance their Techno-Managerial skills.
According to the Bhagvat Gita, Paanchajanya is the conchshell of the Krishna avatar of Lord Vishnu. This conch and its sound symbolizes the victory of dharma over adharma, superiority of light over darkness.<br>
This annual event was named as Paanchajanya by a student Mr.Anurag Agarwal and his team.
Paanchajanya was first held in the year 2006, then onwards this event is held every year as a annual
